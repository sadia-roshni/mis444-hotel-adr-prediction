# Predicting Hotel Average Daily Rate (ADR)

## Project Overview
This project applies predictive analytics techniques to forecast the Average Daily Rate (ADR)
for hotel bookings using machine learning regression models.

## Dataset
The dataset (`hotel_bookings.csv`) was sourced from Kaggle and is included in this repository.

## Methods
- Data preprocessing (missing values, duplicates, outliers)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model development (Linear, Tree-based, and Ensemble models)
- Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation
- Time-based validation
- Business insights and recommendations

## Best Model
Gradient Boosting Regressor achieved the best performance based on RMSE and R².

## Tools
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
